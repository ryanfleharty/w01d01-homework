  Archies-Howl:homework_part_1 jakeshelton$ mkdir death_star
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_1 jakeshelton$ cd death_star
  Archies-Howl:death_star jakeshelton$ touch princess_leia.txt darth_vader.txt storm_trooper.txt

2. In galaxy_far_far_away, make a directory named tatooine and create the following files in it: luke.txt, ben_kenobi.txt
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_1 jakeshelton$ mkdir galaxy_far_far_away
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_1 jakeshelton$ cd galaxy_far_far_away/
  Archies-Howl:galaxy_far_far_away jakeshelton$ mkdir tatooine
  Archies-Howl:galaxy_far_far_away jakeshelton$ cd tatooine
  Archies-Howl:tatooine jakeshelton$ touch luke.txt ben_kenobi.txt

3. Inside of tatooine make a directory called millenium_falcon, and in it create: han_solo.txt, chewbaca.txt
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_1 jakeshelton$ mkdir millenium_falcon
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_1 jakeshelton$ cd millenium_falcon/
  Archies-Howl:millenium_falcon jakeshelton$ touch han_solo.txt chewbacca.txt

Part II: mv - rename
You can rename a file using the mv command.
4. Rename ben_kenobi.txt to obi_wan.txt.
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_2 jakeshelton$ mv galaxy_far_far_away/tatooine/ben_kenobi.txt galaxy_far_far_away/tatooine/obi_wan.txt

Part II: cp - copy
5. You can copy a file from one location to another using the cp command. (man cp for more info)
Directories can be sibling (parallel to each other) or can be parents (the folder that contains the folder you are in)
Copy storm_trooper.txt from death_star to tatooine.
  Archies-Howl:millenium_falcon jakeshelton$ cp ../../../death_star/storm_trooper.txt ../

 Part IV: mv - move
You can use the mv command to move files from one location to another. mv can be used for renaming, moving, or both. Run man mv to see the optionsâ€”remember hit the Q key to get out of the manual page viewer.
6. Move luke.txt and obi_wan.txt to the millenium_falcon.
  Archies-Howl:tatooine jakeshelton$ mv luke.txt millenium_falcon/

Part VII: rm -r: remove directories and everything they contain
BE CAREFUL WITH rm!!! THERE IS NO TRASH CAN IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER
Before you hit enter, make sure are deleting the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).
This command will not typically ask you if you "really want to delete." It will just delete.
20. Remove tie_fighter_2 and tie_fighter_3.
  Archies-Howl:galaxy_far_far_away jakeshelton$ rm -r tie_fighter_2
  Archies-Howl:galaxy_far_far_away jakeshelton$ rm -r tie_fighter_3

Part VIII:
21. Touch a file in x_wing called the_force.txt.

22. Destroy the death_star and anyone inside of it.
  Archies-Howl:galaxy_far_far_away jakeshelton$ cd ..
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_8 jakeshelton$ ls
  commands.txt    death_star    galaxy_far_far_away
  Archies-Howl:homework_part_8 jakeshelton$ rm -r death_star
23. Return x_wing and the millenium_falcon to yavin_4.
  Archies-Howl:galaxy_far_far_away jakeshelton$ mv millenium_falcon/ yavin_4
